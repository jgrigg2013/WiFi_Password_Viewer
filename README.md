## How to use:
Install Python 3.0 or higher.
Copy all files to your computer. (I've included PsExec.exe here, but you can download it directly from the [Microsoft website](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx) if you don't trust an .exe file from a random person on the internet.)

Start Command Prompt as administrator.

Run user_interface.py

```
python user_interface.py
```
